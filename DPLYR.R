# The Five Verbs of dplyr 1. The dplyr package contains five key data manipulation functions, also called verbs:
#   . select(), which returns a subset of the columns,
#   . filter(), that is able to return a subset of the rows, 
#   . arrange(), that reorders the rows according to single or multiple variables, 
#   . mutate(), used to add columns from existing data, 
#   . summarise(), which reduces each group to a single row by calculating aggregate measures.
# What order of operations should we use to to ???nd the average value of the ArrDelay (arrival delay) 
# variable for all American Airline fights in the hfights table

## Manipulate variables

# 2. Return a copy of hfights that contains the four columns related to delay (ActualElapsedTime, AirTime, ArrDelay, DepDelay).

# 3.  Return a copy of hfights containing the columns Origin up to Cancelled 

select(hflights, Origin:Cancelled)

# 4. Find the most concise way to select: columns Year up to and including DayOfWeek, columns ArrDelay up to and 
# including Diverted.

# Cancelled, and CancellationCode columns of h???ights

#Use Piping: (1) Take the hflights data set and then, (2) Add a variable named diff that is the result of subtracting TaxiIn from TaxiOut, and then (3) pick all of the rows whose diff value does not equal NA, and then (4) summarise the data set with a value named avg that is the mean diff value.

# 19. Use Piping to compare the individual carriers. For each carrier, count the total number of ???ights ???own by the carrier (n_???ights), the total number of cancelled ???ights (n_canc), and the average arrival delay of the ???ights whose delay does not equal NA (avg_delay). Once you've calculated these results, arrange() the carriers from low to high by their average arrival delay. Use number of ???ights cancelled to break any ties. Which airline scores best based on these statistics?
